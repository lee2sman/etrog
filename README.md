# Etrog Obscure Instructions

This project produces generative creative prompts. Originally intended as a twitter bot, I think it lives better as a website or software. 

Use 'Etrog Obscure Instructions' for inspiration or contemplation when you need a way to move forward on a creative endeavor.

This is obviously highly inspired by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies<Paste>), Yoko Ono's [instruction pieces](https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/61) and the curatorial omnibus [Do It](https://curatorsintl.org/special-projects/do-it).

If this proves fruitful for you, please [message me](http://twitter.com/2sman2sman).

#### Note

Don't click too rapidly. It's best to click once and accept what you've been dealt! Too much choice is a problem. Constraint is an answer. :)
